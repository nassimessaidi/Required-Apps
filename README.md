# Required Apps using React

This simple project contains all the apps that I need especially when I installed a fresh windows 10 and you may need it you too, as a developer. Some of the apps contains various apps or extensions inside of it, e.g. if you click on Python you will redirected to different libraries I used, also the same with VSCode and Adobe Products
